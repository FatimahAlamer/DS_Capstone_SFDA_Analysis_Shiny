# DS_Capstone_SFDA_Analysis_Shiny
Capstone project for Misk Data Science Immersive Program
## **Summary**
*This project contains two parts:*

1- HTML document which provides a general description for Saudi FDA (SFDA) drugs, with comparing between Saudi drugs and non-Saudi drugs & how much our dependency on non-Saudi drugs.  

2- Shiny app For SFDA contains:  

- All of the registered manufacturing countries in one interactive map with present the name of highest price with each country. I added (Longitude&Latitude)to enable the map.  
- Interactive plot for all registered drugs by country and price, It was impossible to show them in the regular plot due to extreme values, the interactive plot enables that!  
- Interactive Table to allow searching by any keywords, or specifying, registered year, country, drug type, or route of administration  
- Pediatric paracetamol calculator, the most common used drug for children to reduce fever (antipyretic), however, the dose is needed to be calculated based on age, the app provides the calculated dose with integer number without a decimal component
